Ignore code_archive and code_main_copy. Can only look at code_main folder.

Refer to: https://github.com/PrejudiceDDH/Bagging, for general introduction to the submitted codes (which is a subset of the codes here).

1. change base algorithm --> add algorithm function to ParallelSolve.py
    * can add test scripts to utils/xxxx_functions.py (e.g., functions like comparison_twoPhase)
    * change the plotting function in utils/plotting.py

2. test on new problem --> add main solve function (gurobi/sklearn/torch) to ParallelSolve.py
    * create a new script in utils/, discrete problem can copy from SSKP_functions.py; continuous problem can copy from LP_functions.py
    * add a new sample generation function to utils/generateSamples.py
    * when creating the new script, mainly need to change (1) generate sample; (2) change main solve function when calling algorithm functions.
